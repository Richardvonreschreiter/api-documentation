# Energimolnet API v2 (BETA)
Energimolnet collects energy data from any source available. Once collected, developers can easily access it for any purpose and start making amazing stuff.


## Get started

To get started we recommend you to install a tool for making HTTP requests such as <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/advanced-rest-client/hgmloofddffdnphfgcellkdfbfbjeloo" target="_BLANK">Advanced Rest Client</a> or <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman-rest-client/fdmmgilgnpjigdojojpjoooidkmcomcm" target="_BLANK">Postman</a> for Chrome. This is a good way to understand the API *before you start programming*.

We will use Postman in this example. 

1. Enter the following URL <code>https://app.energimolnet.se/api/2.0/users/me/contracts</code>
2. Add a new Header with name <code>Authorization</code> and value <code>OAuth 2f9bf2cccd808358e6850e41c5a765ed</code>
3. Click Send and you'll see a list of available contracts for the **authenticated user**.

Here's a <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/energimolnet/api-documentation/master/images/Postman.png" >screenshot</a> of what it should look like.

<h4>So, what exactly happened here? </h4>
The URL told the API to return all available contracts. I this case there was just one. The Authorization header tells **who is being authenticated** which determines what contracts will be returned. In this example we use a demo-account which has the consumption for Energimolnet's office.

To get information about the authenticated user try <code>https://app.energimolnet.se/api/2.0/users/me</code>.

**NOTE:** In this example we are using an API-token to access a user's data. API-tokens are only to be used by the user and never shared with anyone else. To build apps for other users, then use OAuth and the Code-flow to obtain refresh_tokens and access_tokens.


## Authentication
We use OAuth2 to authenticate users and manages access to third parties. 

NOTE: This API is under development and may change any time.

## Examples

We have created a simple <a href="https://github.com/energimolnet/energimolnet-js-oauth-demo">Javascript</a> that demonstrates how the OAuth2 flow can be implemented. Check out the <a href="http://energimolnet-oauth-demo.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/">demo</a>.

# Group Meters

A meter represents a physical device that measures consumption from a utility such as heat, cooling or electricity.
Each meter has a holder who can **assign** or **share** the meter to other accounts.

Assigned or shared meters references a root meter, and it is good practice to use the
**root._id** as unique identifer in your own applications. The **_id** field only represents the
reference itself, and is used to updated meta-information about the meter such as name, tags or if the meter is active or not.

## Meter [/meters/{id}]

+ Parameters
    + id (string, requires) - Id of the meter.
         

### Get a meter [GET]

+ Response 200 (application/json)
    + Attributes (Meter Base)
 

## Meters collection [/meters?limit={limit}&skip={skip}]
You can list all meters accessible by the authenticated user. By using query params you can limit

### List meters [GET]

# Group Consumption

Consumption is the use of energy or other metrics for a meter. Consumption is measured by the granularity month, day and hour but the availabilty depends and the consumption feed from the meter's owner.

<h3>Metrics</h3>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>energy</td><td>Amount of energy used, always measured in kWh</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>flow</td><td>Amount of fluid used, always measured in m<sup>3</sup></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>power</td><td>Averge power, measured in kW. The timeframe is the same as the requested granularity.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Aggregated consumptions [/consumptions/account/{account_id}/{metric}/{granularity}/{period}]

You can also get aggregated consumptions for all meters accessable by an account holder. If you 
pass a developer's <code>account_id</code>, you will get the aggregated values for all meters that the developer has 
access to thanks to granted access using **shared_with**.

Passing an owner's account_id will return aggregated values for meters that has that owner as owner.

Passing an user's accound_id will return aggregated valus for all meters accessable by that user, that is: meters accessable
thanks to **shared_with** will also be insluded in the aggregation.

### Get aggregated consumption for an account [GET]

+ Response 200 (application/json)
